Time management is going to be crucial for my success at Turing. In addition to attending class, I will need to schedule time to complete the tasks given to me. All the while, being sure to give myself time to live and do other things that make me happy.

Sometimes concepts will be introduced to me that I might not understand immediately and that is okay. We are learning a new language and just like learning any new concept, things may not make sense immediately but I can trust in the process.

I have never been one to use a calendar. But making a calendar for Mod0 has been very helpful. Moving forward, I will make a calendar for the module I am in and it will help me plan out success.

It is okay to ask for help. My cohort is going through the same learning that I am and asking them for help will enable everyone to understand better.

Thank you to HeatherRae who has been a wonderful supportive friend through this process of leaving my job and exploring something new!
