Time management is going to be crucial for my success at Turing. In addition to attending class, I will need to schedule time to complete the tasks given to me. All the while, being sure to give myself time to live and do other things that make me happy.

Sometimes concepts will be introduced to me that I might not understand immediately and that is okay. We are learning a new language and just like learning any new concept, things may not make sense immediately but I can trust in the process.
